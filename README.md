# CapstoneProjectCS
This Capstone project creates a map of the United States and uses a choropleth to color coat it based upon church need in the Southern Baptist Convention.
The numbers are determined by the 2020 Census data of each county in the US.

Included is my main thesis and Capstone Paper.
