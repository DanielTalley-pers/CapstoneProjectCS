# CapstoneProjectCS
This Capstone project creates a map of the United States. This map uses a choropleth to color coat it based upon church need in the Southern Baptist Convention.
The numbers are determined by the 2020 Census data of each county in the US.
The calculations are performed by comparing the number adherants vs the total population the that county.

The map could be used in two ways.
1. To see where churches need to be planted based upon the total number of adherents already there compared to the total population.
2. To see where churches need to be planted based upon the lack of adherents in an area vs the total population.

Much more data could be used to determine a more accurate result, however this project is the initial prototype of my idea.

Included is my main thesis and Capstone Paper.
